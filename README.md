# <p align="center">APSD up to 100 kHz raw data measured in the
IPEN/MB-01 research nucelar reactor facility</p>


This repository was built for the raw data from the subcritical neutron noise experiments performed in the IPEN/MB-01 research nuclear reactor facility. The subcriticality was reached by poisoning the reactor water with boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>) in the concentrations of 286.8 and 578.6 ppm of natural boron. The subcritical reactivities were respectively -8.95$ and -17.43$. The Auto Power Spectral Densities (APSD) were inferred employing the IPEN/MB-01 Correlator (a set of instrumentation and software) and were best described by a four-mode decay model up to about 70 kHz.

Two articles were written for those experiments, one with the description of the data in Data in Brief Journal and the other published at Annals of Nuclear Energy dealing with the measurement procedure and analysis. The references for the articles are below:
